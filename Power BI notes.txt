DAX(Data Analysis Expression) functions
=======================================

Date functions
--------------
TODAY():-  Display the latest date
syntax:-   =today()

FORMAT():- Display the date format like this "dd-mm-yyyy"
syntax:-  =format('tablename'[column name],"dd-mm-yyyy")

If you want to display the last 10 days data we can follow this syntax

syntax:-  =CALENDAR(today()-10,today())


NOW() :-It will display the current date and time (or) last refresh datetime
syntax:- =NOW()

UTCTODAY():-It will display the universal date and time
syntax:-=UTCTODAY()

UTCNOW():- display the current universal date and time
syntax:- =UTCNOW()

DATEDIFF():- It will display the difference between two dates (or) finding the age and experience by using this function
syntax:- =DATEDIFF(date1,date2,interval)
example:-DATEDIFF(date(1995-07-10),today(),year/month/day/hour/minutes/seconds/milliseconds)



















========Power BI interview questions and answers=================

1. what is power bi?
Ans:Power bi is a cloud based data sharing environment.Once you have developed reports using power query,poewr pivot and power view you 
    can share your insights with your colleagues.power bi which technically ia an aspects of share point online,lets you load excelwork

	from different data sources like oracle,sql,text/csv files,excel,etc and even delete from differentsources.
	power pivot:
	===========  It is used for data modeling that uses DAX(Data analysis Expression) functions for the calculations. relationships
	between different tables can also be created here and we can get values that can be shown in pivot tables.
	power view:
	=========== The power view is used for providing an intuitive display of the data and retrieving the metadata for data analysis
	the views are interactive in nature and slicers and filter can be used for slicing and dicing the data.
	power bi desktop:
	================= power desktop is an integration tool for power query,power view,power pivot.it helps to create advanced queries
	data models,reports and dashboard and helps in developing your bi skills for data analysis
	power Bi Mobile Application:

	power map:
	========== it presents geo-spatial visualization of the data in 3 dimensional mode. the data can be highlighted based on the 
	geographical location which can be continent,state,city or even street address.
